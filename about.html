    <p>Jamaica was first home to the Taino people. In 1494, Christopher Columbus arrived in Jamaica, encountering the indigenous Taíno people (also called Arawaks) who already inhabited the island, marking the start of Spanish colonization, the forced labor and eventual demise of the Taíno through disease and conflict, and paving the way for the island's transformation into a significant British colony, leading to its rich, multicultural history as a melting pot. </p>

    <p>Jamaica is located in the Caribbean Sea. It is the third-largest island  in the Caribbean, after Cuba and Hispaniola, and it forms part of the Greater Antilles. Known for its rich cultural heritage, lush mountains, and vibrant music traditions such as reggae, Jamaica is an influential nation both regionally and globally.</p>
