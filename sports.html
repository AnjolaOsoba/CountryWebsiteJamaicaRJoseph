        Jamaica is known worldwide for producing some of the fastest runners in history. Athletes like 
        Usain Bolt, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, Elaine Thompson-Herah, and Asafa Powell have broken world 
        records and won multiple Olympic medals. Jamaica’s success comes from hard work, natural talent, 
        and a strong track and field program that begins in primary school. Every year, the island holds 
        “Champs,” a huge national competition where young athletes compete and often get discovered.

        Cricket has been played in Jamaica for over 100 years and is one of the island’s oldest sports. 
        Jamaica is part of the West Indies cricket team, a group of Caribbean nations that compete 
        together at international tournaments. The West Indies team has won several global championships 
        and produced legendary players. Cricket is still loved today, with games played in schools, 
        communities, and professional leagues.

    <h2>Other Sports</h2>

        Jamaica may be famous for sprinting, but the island also competes in many other sports. Swimmer 
        Alia Atkinson became one of Jamaica’s most successful athletes by setting world records in 
        breaststroke events. Jamaicans also enjoy football (soccer), netball, and even bobsledding, 
        which became popular after the famous “Cool Runnings” Olympic story. These sports show that 
        Jamaica has talent in many different areas, not just track and field.
