        Jamaican food is full of bold spices, rich flavors, and slow-cooked meals that reflect the island’s 
        history and culture. Popular dishes include jerk chicken, curry goat, ackee and saltfish, festivals, 
        and Jamaican patties. Jamaicans also love oxtail, which is seasoned with herbs and slow-cooked until 
        tender. Almost every dish is cooked with ingredients like thyme, scallion, and Scotch bonnet pepper, 
        which give Jamaican food a unique taste known around the world.

        Jamaica is famous for creating reggae music, a genre that has influenced people all around the world. 
        One of the most important musical icons is Bob Marley, whose songs spread messages of peace, love, 
        and freedom. Jamaica also created ska, dancehall, and rocksteady, each with its own rhythm and style. 
        Music is a huge part of everyday life in Jamaica and is played at events, celebrations, and festivals 
        all year round.

        Jamaican traditions are colorful, energetic, and full of history. One of the oldest traditions is 
        Jonkonnu, a festival with dancers in bright costumes and masks. Jamaicans celebrate many holidays 
        including Independence Day, Emancipation Day, Christmas, and Carnival. The island is also known for 
        its friendly culture — people often greet each other with “Wah Gwaan,” showing the warm and welcoming 
        spirit that Jamaica is known for.
